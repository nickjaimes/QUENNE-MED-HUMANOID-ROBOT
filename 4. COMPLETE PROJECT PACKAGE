13. RISK ANALYSIS & MITIGATION

13.1 Technical Risks

Quantum Hardware Development Risk:

```
Risk: Quantum processors may not achieve required coherence times
Probability: Medium (30%)
Impact: High (6-12 month delay, $50M additional cost)
Mitigation:
1. Multiple quantum approaches (superconducting, photonic, trapped ion)
2. Classical fallback systems for all quantum algorithms
3. Partnerships with established quantum companies (IBM, Google)
4. Conservative timeline with buffer for technical challenges
Status: Currently on track, early prototypes showing promising results
```

AI Safety and Accuracy Risk:

```
Risk: AI algorithms may not achieve required accuracy or make unsafe decisions
Probability: Low (10%)
Impact: Critical (project failure, regulatory rejection)
Mitigation:
1. Extensive validation testing (10,000+ test cases)
2. Human-in-the-loop for critical decisions
3. Independent ethics review board
4. Continuous monitoring and improvement
